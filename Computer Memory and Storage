Type of Memory:-
1. RAM (Random Access Memory)
    1. Stores data temporarily while computer is running
    2. Itâ€™s fast and flexible.
    3. It is volatile - means it will loose data if power is off.
    4. RAM is multiple type:-
        1. SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)
            1. It is fast and expensive type of RAM.
            2. Used in high speed applications like CPU caches where  quick access time is crucial.
        2. DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
            1. It is slower and cheaper.
            2. It needs to be constantly refreshed to retain data further making it more high maintanance.
            3. DRAM is of multiple types further: -
                1. FPM DRAM - obsolete
                2. EDO DRAM - obsolete
                3. SDRAM
                4. DDR SDRAM - currently below two types are running in market
                    1. DDR4
                    2. DDR5
                5. GDDR SDRAM - 
                    1. It is specialised type of DRAM optimised for faster data transfer rate which GPU needs for massive parallel processing.
                    2. GDDR6 is most widely used today.
2. ROM (Read Only Memory)
    1. It contains data even when power is off.
    2. It stores important information which computer needs to boot up
        1. BIOS
        2. Firmware

Types of Storage: -
1. HDD (Hard Disk Drives)
    1. It has been around for long time.
    2. They store data on spinning magnetic disks and are known for their large storage capacities at a low price.
2. SSD (Solid State Drives)
    1. It used NAND-based flash memory, providing faster data access, reduced power consumption and increased durability compared to HDDs, but come at higher price.
    2. NVMe or Non Volatile Memory Express is a high performance interface for SSDs that connects directly to CPU via PCIe lanes. This allow lower latency and significantly faster data transfer rates compared to SATA-based SSDs.
3. USB Drive
4. SD Card
